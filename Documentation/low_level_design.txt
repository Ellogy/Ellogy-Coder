⏺ Ellogy Coder - Low-Level Design Analysis

  Based on my comprehensive analysis of the repository, here's the reverse-engineered low-level design:

  Architecture Overview

  Ellogy Coder is a sophisticated AI-powered code generation and development platform built on modern web technologies. It's essentially a web-based IDE that leverages AI
  models to generate, edit, and manage code projects in real-time.

  Core Technology Stack

  Frontend Framework

  - Remix (v2.15.2) - Full-stack React framework for server-side rendering
  - React (v18.3.1) - UI component library
  - TypeScript - Type-safe JavaScript
  - Vite (v5.4.11) - Build tool and development server

  Styling & UI

  - UnoCSS (v0.61.9) - Atomic CSS engine with custom Ellogy blue theme
  - Tailwind-compatible reset and utilities
  - Radix UI components for accessible primitives
  - Framer Motion for animations and transitions

  State Management

  - Nanostores - Atomic state management
  - Zustand - Additional state management for complex scenarios

  Development Environment

  - WebContainer API (v1.6.1) - Browser-based Node.js runtime
  - CodeMirror (v6.x) - Advanced code editor with language support
  - Xterm.js (v5.5.0) - Terminal emulator in the browser

  2. Core Components Deep Dive

  Chat System (app/components/chat/)

  - BaseChat.tsx: Main chat interface with AI interaction
  - Messages.client.tsx: Message rendering and streaming
  - ChatBox: Input handling, file uploads, voice recognition
  - APIKeyManager: Multi-provider API key management
  - Supports 15+ AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Ollama, etc.)

  Workbench (app/components/workbench/)

  - Workbench.client.tsx: Main IDE interface
  - EditorPanel.tsx: CodeMirror-based code editor
  - Preview.tsx: Live preview of web applications
  - FileTree.tsx: File system navigation
  - Terminal.tsx: Integrated terminal
  - DiffView.tsx: Code diff visualization

  State Management (app/lib/stores/)

  - workbench.ts: Central store for IDE state (874 lines)
    - File management with CRUD operations
    - Document editing and unsaved changes tracking
    - Git integration for GitHub push
    - ZIP download functionality
    - File locking system
  - chat.ts: Chat history and AI interaction state
  - editor.ts: Code editor document management
  - files.ts: File system operations
  - terminal.ts: Terminal session management

  3. AI Integration Architecture

  Multi-Provider Support

  // Supported AI providers from package.json:
  - @ai-sdk/anthropic (Claude)
  - @ai-sdk/openai (GPT models)
  - @ai-sdk/google (Gemini)
  - @ai-sdk/amazon-bedrock
  - @ai-sdk/cohere
  - @ai-sdk/deepseek
  - @ai-sdk/mistral
  - ollama-ai-provider (Local models)
  - @openrouter/ai-sdk-provider

  Action System

  - ActionRunner: Executes AI-generated actions (file operations, shell commands)
  - Message Parser: Parses AI responses into executable actions
  - Streaming Support: Real-time action execution during AI response streaming

  4. File System & Runtime

  WebContainer Integration

  - Browser-based Node.js environment
  - Real file system operations without server
  - Package management (npm/pnpm install)
  - Live preview server

  File Operations

  interface FileOperations {
    createFile(path: string, content: string | Uint8Array): Promise<boolean>
    deleteFile(path: string): Promise<boolean>
    saveFile(path: string, content: string): Promise<void>
    lockFile(path: string): boolean  // Prevents AI editing
    unlockFile(path: string): boolean
  }

  5. User Interface Design

  Layout System

  - Header: Logo, navigation, settings
  - Chat Panel: AI conversation interface (resizable)
  - Workbench: Three-view system (Code/Diff/Preview)
  - Sidebar: File tree, settings, provider configuration

  Responsive Design

  - Mobile-first approach with breakpoints
  - Collapsible panels for small screens
  - Touch-friendly controls

  Theme System

  Custom Ellogy blue theme with CSS variables:
  :root {
    --bolt-elements-textPrimary: #1a5eec;
    --bolt-elements-button-primary-background: #1a5eec;
    // ... extensive theme variables
  }

  6. Deployment & Infrastructure
